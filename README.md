# Linux setup

This is my setup script to install a linux machine with all my config and softwares I like with low effort.

I was inspired by [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) to do this with my own setup.

> [!WARNING]
> Running shell scripts you don't know is dangerous! All the scripts are commented so they are easier to audit. Don't trust me and read through the file before installing!

# Features

The setup

# Installation

- Install [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) (Gnome DE is really important)
- Run `sudo dnf upgrade -y` to have everything up to date
Run this command in the terminal:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasileBux/linux_setup/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```
